## What is FPVGate?

FPVGate measures lap times by detecting your drone's video transmitter signal strength (RSSI). When you fly through the gate, it detects the peak signal and records your lap time. No transponders, no complex setup—just plug in, calibrate, and fly.

## How It Works

FPVGate uses an RX5808 video receiver module to monitor your drone's RSSI (signal strength). As you fly through the gate:

1. **Approach** - RSSI rises above Enter threshold → crossing starts
2. **Peak** - RSSI peaks when you're closest to the gate
3. **Exit** - RSSI falls below Exit threshold → lap recorded

The time between peaks = your lap time. Simple, reliable, and accurate.

```
RSSI  │     /\
      │    /  \
      │   /    \     ← Single clean peak
Enter ├──/──────\───
      │ /        \
Exit  ├/──────────\─
      └─────────────── Time
```
